# 🚀 CodeSprint 2.0 – My Coding Journey

Welcome to my repository for **CodeSprint 2.0**, a 45-day coding marathon organized by [USC KIIT]. This challenge is designed to sharpen problem-solving skills through daily coding tasks that span across logic, loops, conditionals, arrays, and more — all with increasing difficulty levels.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is not just about solving problems — it’s about consistency, learning, debugging, and pushing the boundaries of logic and code efficiency one problem at a time.

By the end of 45 days, this journey will be a reflection of my growth as a coder and a learner.
