# 🚀 CodeSprint 2.0 – My Coding Journey

Welcome to my repository for CodeSprint 2.0, a 45-day coding marathon organized by USC KIIT. This challenge is designed to sharpen problem-solving skills through daily coding tasks that span across logic, loops, conditionals, arrays, linked lists, sorting algorithms, and more — all with increasing difficulty levels. From basic conditionals and array manipulations to advanced data structures like linked lists and complex algorithmic patterns, this journey covers essential programming concepts that build a strong foundation for technical interviews and real-world problem solving.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is not just about solving problems — it’s about consistency, learning, debugging, and pushing the boundaries of logic and code efficiency.
By the end of 45 days, this journey will be a reflection of my growth as a coder and a learner.
